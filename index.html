                        The design choices highlight the uniqueness of the idea behind the <code>Rush</code>
                        a bike meant for those who are not afraid to stand-out of the crowd with out-of-the-ordinary details, such as she lenticular rear-wheel, typical of acceleration races.

                    <p>The inline-four-cylinder engine of the Brutale 1000RR, the result of an accurate development process, offers record power of 208 hp (153 kW) at 13000 rpm, that further increases to 212 hp (156 kW) in racetrack configuration. Torque stands at 116.5 Nm. The combustion chamber has been completely redesigned, drawing on Formula 1 technology.</p>

                    <p>
                        An evolution of the original <code>Brutale</code>
                        the iconic sports naked that rocked the motorcycling world.
                
                    </p>
                    <p>MV Agusta’s Brutale is probably the most acclaimed modern-age naked sports bike. The Brutale concept was born in 2000 from the inspired imagination of MV Agusta star designer Massimo Tamburini. The intuition of Tamburini was that he imagined a naked bike right from the start, designed to do without fairings or unnecessary details, and not as the result of the reverse, stripping-down process of a regular bike. It was conceived and built to be naked, with its beastly aggressive and ruthless looks that make it immediately recognisable.</p>
